                        I worked on gameplay events, interactables, gears and online multiplayer functionality for the expansion. A relatively short devlopment time required making enjoyable and replayable content using limited assets.

                        I worked on gameplay events, interactables and gears for the expansion, making sure they all worked for up to four players in online multiplayer. I also developed the gameplay for the smaller and vastly different areas of the game, made up of self-contained "rifts".

                         I was an owner of the Super Duper add-on, responsible for compliling ideas, and getting the team to make smart decisions along the way, since the entire pack had to go from ideation to shipping state in only six weeks. I was also responsible for prototyping gears and frequently iterating on the designs along with programmers and artists.

                        I've made a number of personal projects through the years, where I've usually done all the graphics (with some exceptions) and coding myself. These have ranged from roguelikes to couch co-op "sports" games, 2.5D beat-em-ups, as well as just general weird experiences I've wanted to try out.

                    <p>
                        This prepared me for the challenges of communicating across disciplines, both during my game design studies as well as in my professional role as part of a game studio.

                        Game design at its most playful is about drawing inspiration from the world around you and funneling that into a compelling player experience. It's about having fun with the game and the elements you are designing. It's one of my favorite things to do in life.

                    I've been playing and, in some capacity, making games since the Commodore 64 days, creating may own simple games in Basic. I got attracted to the simpler ideas and premises of indie games in the 2010's, and the idea of making my own games suddenly didn't feel that far off.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2016, I started making my own video games in my spare time. While steadily expanding my technical knowledge of game engines, I noticed I enjoyed solving the myriad of design questions arising from a certain kind of game or a specific set of self-imposed limitations. In 2018 I started studying game design at Future Games, furthering my understaning of what each discipline can bring to the design of a game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've been at Coffee Stain North since 2022, currently as a Senior Game Designer, working on the Multiverse of Nonsense and Baadlands DLCs, as well as the Hocus Pocus and Super Duper add-ons.
